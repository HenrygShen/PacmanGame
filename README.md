A JavaFX game written in collaboration with [a fellow student](https://github.com/lincolnChoy).    

Introduction :    
This is a game that is a parody mix between Pacman and Indiana Jones.    
The player may play as Pacman in an Indiana Jones themed setting, where they need to collect artifacts    
and avoid the ghosts in the maze. The special pellet grants the player 3 whip charges, to help them   
fight off the ghosts and clear the map more easily. Traps will occasionally spawn too.     

The player is given 2 minutes to clear each map and a total of 3 lives per map.    
There are 4 differently themed maps. Jungle, Ruins, Sea, and Desert.    

This game can be single player or multiplayer( max of 4 total players ), where Player One will    
play as Pacman and the other three will play as the ghosts.

There is a leaderboard function, which will display the top 3 scores with their corresponding maps.    
Any player may record their score and name, given that they have beaten the previous 3 high scores.    

All assets were self-made using Photoshop, Paint and Audacity.    
JavaFX Scene Builder was used to format the layouts of each scene.

As you may have noticed, for certain reasons we had to name the game Pacamana Jane.
